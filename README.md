# countryFlag
A js library that returns country flag from country name.

#### CDN Link ```https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jaiakash/countryFlag@master/countryFlag.js```

### Sample.js
```
import { getCountryImage } from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jaiakash/countryFlag@master/countryFlag.js"
...
var country = "India";
console.log(getCountryImage(country));
...
```

I made this while working on different project that needed country code from country name. I found library for converting country code to country name but not vice versa. I hope this could help others so that they dont need to reinvent the wheel.
